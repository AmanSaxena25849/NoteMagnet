          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>NoteMagnet was born from a simple frustration: traditional note-taking tools were either too complicated or too limited. As a software developer with a passion for productivity, I set out to create something different—a platform that combines simplicity with power.</p>
          <p>What started as a personal project in early 2024 quickly evolved into a mission to revolutionize how people capture and share their thoughts, knowledge, and ideas.</p>
          <p>Today, NoteMagnet exists to make notes "stick" in a world full of distractions—bringing together intuitive design, powerful organization tools, and seamless sharing capabilities.</p>

          <p class="developer-bio">Hi, I'm Aman — a passionate backend developer and the creator of NoteMagnet, a collaborative platform built to make studying smarter, easier, and more social. I'm deeply driven by clean, efficient code and always exploring ways to bridge backend logic with practical frontend impact. My stack includes Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, DRF, Celery and I love building fast, secure, and scalable web apps.</p>
          <p>Beyond code, I believe in knowledge sharing and community learning. That’s why NoteMagnet isn't just a project — it’s my contribution to making study materials more discoverable, engaging, and collaborative.</p>
          <p>Whether you're a fellow coder or a student looking for helpful notes, I'm always open to connect, collaborate, and improve. Let’s learn together.</p>

      <h2>My Vision for the Future of Notes</h2>
      <p>I believe note-taking should be more than just digital text on a screen. Notes should be dynamic, interconnected, and intelligent—adapting to how we think and work.</p>
      <p>The future of notes isn't just about capturing information; it's about transforming how we interact with our own knowledge. At NoteMagnet, I'm building tools that help ideas connect naturally, surface when you need them, and grow as your thinking evolves.</p>
      <p>My goal is to create an ecosystem where your notes become an extension of your mind—a true second brain that enhances your creativity, productivity, and learning.</p>
